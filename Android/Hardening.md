### Android Application Hardening Controls
Description: This checklist will help android developers to harden their application during the development phase.

  - Encrypt shared preferences
    - Reference: https://github.com/scottyab/secure-preferences
  - Avoid storing sensitive information withing shared preferences even if you are using encrypted shared preferences
  - Encrpyt SQLite database
    - Reference: https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher
  - Application must not store any sensitive information in system logs.
  - Application must not store any sensitive information in SQLitedb for any kind of analystic purpose.
  - No extra permission should be taken from user than the intended one.
  - Implement hmacSHA256 encryption within request and response in order to avoid tampering 
    - Reference: http://infosecninja.blogspot.in/2016/09/android-application-security-tamper.html
  - Use proguard/dexguard for source code ofuscation.

    - http://proguard.sourceforge.net/
  - Disallow user to run application on rooted devices and old Android versions 4.1 >=
  - Implement best available solution for SSL pinning
    - 1. Using a simple HttpsURLConnection with a PinningTrustManager
    - 2. Using a simple HttpClient with a PinningTrustManager
    - 3. Work with PinningTrustManager and PinningSSLSocketFactory more directly

  - Do not export more than required activities of post login which can be directly triggered via adb by attackers.
  - If require, there must be a valid intent filter
  - Do not share sensitive information on SD card which is publicly available even non-rooted devices.
  - If there is file upload mechanism then follow best practices for file upload on server side.
    - Upload feature testcases - http://apps.testinsane.com/mindmaps/Uploads/Upload.png
  - Implement 2/3 minutes of throttling between two consecutive requests made to the server. It helps to avoid all security scanners that can be executed on your api server, backend web application.
  - Do not store sensitive data in cache at client side.
  - Enable local session timeout.
    - User's account must ask for login on inactivity of 10 minutes. If user's mobile device is stolen/theft then this feature becomes handy to protect user's account and data being stolen/tampered.
  - Disable debug logs
  - Use secure settings for cookies
  - Use tokens for account numbers instead of using account numbers directly which are pertaining to users.
  - Avoid simple logic which can be easily guessable by an attackers.
  - Disable clipboard copy paste
  - Use latest and secure 3rd party libraries
  - Implement file permissions carefully.
    - Do not create files using MODE_WORLD_READABLE and MODE_WORLD_WRITABLE
  - Implement content providers carefully.
  - Implement best practices for webview access.
    - Disable JavaScript access.
    - Disable local file access.
  - Disallow application to run post tamper detection. Log analystics on server side for further investigation.
  - Implement 2FA for financial application if required.
  - Validate all inputs from client side.
  - API server must be over TLS 1.2 or later.
  - Implement web services carefully and pentest it via 3rd party server.
